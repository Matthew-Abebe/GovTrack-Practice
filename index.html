        <h2>Legislation</h2>
        <p>PREEMIE Reauthorization Act (S. 252; 113th Congress) – a bill that would reauthorize research programs on
            preterm births that are run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It would also authorize
            grants and demonstration programs to be run by the Health Resources and Services Administration that will
            try to decrease preterm births. It passed the Senate on September 25, 2013.
            Exchange Information Disclosure Act – a bill that would require the government to report on the number of
            visitors and enrollees on the federal government's healthcare exchanges, as well as what level of insurance
            coverage people buy on the exchanges. The bill would apply only to the federally-run healthcare exchanges,
            which cover 36 states, not the state-run exchanges, according to Ripon Advance. On January 16, 2014, the
            U.S. House passed the bill. Its companion bill Exchange Information Disclosure Act (H.R. 3362; 113th
            Congress) was introduced in the House by Rep. Lee Terry (R, NE-2)<p>
